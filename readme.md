## A react / fastify server boilerplate.

A react boilerplate with a fastify backend server. Comes equipped with TailwindCss, React, Fastify, Vite.js, react-router, react-router-link and react-icons.

This is what I will generally use when creating a react app while also needing a backend. Feel free to make changes to this and submit a pull request if you come up with improvements.
